# odin-recipes


This is an exercise from The Odin Project that tests my HTML abilities by creating multiple pages strictly from HTML. Pages include a main page and three recipe pages. The recipe pages include a "description", ingredients, and instructions. By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated these skills:

-HTML boilerplate
-Adeuqately setting a title and including the meta element
-Using header elements
-Using strong and emphasis elements
-Linking one html page to another
-Using spacing and style choices to format a page in HTML
-Using unordered and ordered lists elements
-Using list item elements
-Using multiple and varied header elements
-Using paragraph elements
-Using a footer element

This project was a lot of fun, and it's easy to see how HTML can be beautiful in its simplicity. While there are a couple of things that I was disappointed that I was not able to do yet (due to a lack of knowledge), such as resizing images and aligning text and headers, I can see how you can do a lot on a web page with just HTML. While I have no doubt that things will get more complicated when CSS and JavaScript come into play, I am glad to have a decent grasp on the basics, and will refer to this project when I get discouraged.
